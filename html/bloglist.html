           <h2>History of Technology</h2>
           <p>The term technology is derived from the ancient Greek words “techne” and “logos”, which translates to “art, craft” and “word, speech” respectively. The term was used for the first time in the 17th century, and it was denoted to mean “a discussion of the applied arts”. However, with the industrial movement beginning in the 20th century, the term “technology” was used to represent a range of processes and techniques, in addition to machinery and tools. Over time, the term was used to associate scientific progress and breakthroughs in various disciplines.</p>
